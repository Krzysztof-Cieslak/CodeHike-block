# CodeHike Block

[![name](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Blocks-Build%20with%20%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%EF%B8%8F-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://blocks.githubnext.com/)

Block for displaying code walkthroughs with [CodeHike](https://codehike.org/). It's best used together with Markdown Block - to embed the walkthroughs directly in your interactive Readme. 
Here below, is the basic example of how to use it in the readme:

<BlockComponent
block={{"owner":"Krzysztof-Cieslak","repo":"CodeHike-block","id":"codeHike-block","type":"file"}}
context={{"repo":"CodeHike-block","owner":"Krzysztof-Cieslak","path":"examples/codehike.mdx","sha":"HEAD","file":"README.md"}}
height={931}
/>
And here is another, longer example: 

<BlockComponent
block={{"owner":"Krzysztof-Cieslak","repo":"CodeHike-block","id":"codeHike-block","type":"file"}}
context={{"repo":"CodeHike-block","owner":"Krzysztof-Cieslak","path":"examples/Scrollycoding.mdx","sha":"HEAD","file":"README.md"}}
height={398}
/>
The implementation is based on the [CodeHike Playground](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/tree/next/playground)

## How to contribute

_Imposter syndrome disclaimer_: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can [read here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
